# Upskilling as a Data Scientist 

::: {.notes}
- Hello everyone, my name is Dave
- Thank you for having me here, esp to organizers for putting this together
- Excited to connect with data community here in New England
- Last year I moved to New England last year from Old England
- And I'm looking forward to talking about R at this Tableau group 
- I have tried to keep the R evangelizing to a minimum
- Bc really the high level point I want to make in this talk is:
:::

# Solving real world problems, not finishing assigned projects is what makes you a better data scientist

::: {.notes}
- And R and many of the tools I will show you over the next 30 minutes are a great way to help you quickly solve real world problems
- Saying it out loud sounds a bit like a platitude, but hopefully by the end of the talk, you'll see what I mean
- I wrote this talk specifically with students and more junior colleagues in mind
- Always hope to write the talk I wish I could have heard when I was younger
:::

## Why on mind? 

![](vid/dsw.png)

::: {.notes}
- last client was end point assessing org in UK
- acted as independent assessor for masters students finishing data science projects
- saw maybe 40 projects people did to improve, got me thinking about the lull between employment 
- thinking of what to do
::: 

## Why upskill?

::: {.incremental}
- Technology landscape is always changing
- Double Edged Sword
  + Intellectually stimulating 
  + Anxiety inducing, especially if you're more junior
- Juniors: need to differentiate yourself 
  + LLMs
  + Mass Layoffs
- **Make your own life easier, more hireable, more value to colleagues and organization** 
:::

::: {.notes}
- If you work in data, it's nearly impossible to NOT be constantly learning new things
- CLICK Landscape of technology is always changing
- Each week my LinkedIn feed is I feel inundated with new tech stacks, the latest models, frameworks
- CLICK This is of course a double edged sword though
- CLICK Can be fun if you are securely positioned, have someone to guide you, can be very intellectually stimulating and reason we got into data
- Flip side is this can be anxiety inducing if you're more junior, but I feel it as well
- Particular pressure for junior data scientists apparent now and even
- Six years ago, when hiring market was on fire, students I had still worried about how to differentiate themselves
- CLICK
- Add in existence of LLMs, mass governmental layoffs, and a poor job market, it sucks
- Probably don't need to make specific argument, but always good to be explicit
:::

## Not enough just to tell, must show

::: {.incremental}
- Showing with **Projects** proof
  + Externally motivated (a.k.a. boss tells you what to do)
  + Data already exists  (a.k.a pre-packaged data)
  + Tools > Everything Else 
  + "Solution in search of a problem"
- Nothing wrong with this, siloed for a reason  
- _Alternative approach if you want to really improve your skillset_
:::

::: {.notes}
- Whether trying to get a job, or continue in current career, unfortunately can't just read a book then say you did that
- Often need to have evidence showing your skills and improvements
- CLICK
- Sometimes do this with what might be called the **Projects** approach
  + Externally mandated (e.g. boss, teacher tells you what to do)
  + Externally sourced (e.g. pre-packaged data)
  + Tools > Everything Else 
  + "Solution in search of a problem"
- Traditional approach, siloed for a reason
- Going to provide alt framework other than what I'll refer to as project approach, contrast this with problem approach
:::

## Problems, not projects

::: {.incremental}

- Showing proof by solving **Problems**
- Intrinsically motivated: Unbounded problem space (a.k.a **you** need to decide the bounds)
- Data does not already live in a CSV or database
- Problem drives tech choices
- "Problem in search of solution"
- Basically... find a small real world problem and solve it
::: 

::: {.notes}
- In contrast to projects, w/ problems, tech serves the problem
- Read list 
- Good thing is not only are we in golden age of democritized learning, but also lots of good content about entrpreunship
- Preaching to choir on this, given literally standing at Roux Institute
- Essentially saying you want to create a tiny, tiny business
- Or, MicroSaas
- Goal is to build it, tethering yourself to reality, with something manable
:::

# What is a MicroSaaS? 

::: {.notes}
- New term to me
:::

# What is a Micro<span style="color:red;">SaaS</span>? 

::: {.notes}
- SaaS: Software as a Service 
- Build once, ship infinately 
:::

# What is a <span style="color:red;">Micro</span>SaaS? 

::: {.notes}
- Micro refers to two things:
  + market you are trying to serve, a niche
  + size of the team: single person, small team
:::

## 

::: {.incremental}
![](fig/whatismicrosaas.png)
:::

::: {.notes}
- I like this description of it from Hackernoon I found
- Taken from video in the post
- Read it 
- SaaS: has to be a service that provides real value to your niche
- Focus here is not growth and scaling, small, constitent user base
- Question is then: what problem can I solve?

# Thesis in a Nutshell

::: {.incremental}

1. Try to build a MicroSaaS
2. Get forced to wear more than your data scientist hat
3. See your data science work through a novel lens 
4. (Maybe use R to do it?)
:::

::: {.notes}
- click through and read 
- going to tell you what I have learned by going through this process myself
:::

## What problem can I solve? 


![](fig/foundermarketfit.png)

::: {.notes}
- questions you want to try to solve is what problem can you solve 
- If truly unbounded problem space, really COULD be anything
- advice that I found quite helpful was from this Y Combinator Video 
- Essentially, keyword in the question
:::

## Keyword: _I_

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Recent freelance fractional CFO work
- Knowledge and network in performing arts 
- Recently read book on how churn affects revenue in arts
- Asked network what kinds of problems existed for real people in this space
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

![](fig/runbusiness.png)

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
- few months ago, where I found myself was:
- read slides
- Asked around for problems
- Started asking around, and appeared there was demand for better data analytics in arts
:::

# Analyze ticketing data so performing arts organizations can understand their patron’s financial behavior

::: {.notes}
- Had technical and domain knowledge for calculations
- Was told there is demand to better use data, but not always technical know-how
- Data needed to make these calculations is tracked by most organizations
:::

## Truly, what are the specs of an MVP?

Requirements:

1. Upload historical ticket data
2. Faster and more streamline than Excel 
3. Output easily understood by non-technical user
4. Maximum two months (Jan, Feb of 2025) 

::: {.notes}
- At point where needed to dust off some work (since just freelance last year)
- Unlike taking a project where I might pick stack first, started with final use case in mind
- Requirements:  (could I build something that)
  + do it at a scale where people who used it excel broke
  + have the UI be simple enough that assuming right format of data, delivers this easily?
  + create it with non-technical users in mind. Assume they can get the data in the right format and know what numbers mean, but that's it
  + love this charlotte wickham quote that says if you have to learn it, made software, not a dashboard
  + return to this point when thinking about UI
  + maximum two month bound 
:::


## What do **I** want out of this?

::: {.incremental}

- No idea if this would work or not 
- Establish principles at start so however it goes, it's investment in self
  + (Goal: become a better data scientist)
:::
  
## Wish List

::: {.incremental}
- Improve my ability to make interactive dashboards
  + (mostly Quarto before, never serious shiny)
- See what all the AI LLM hype is about to assist with coding
- Productionize what I built
- Write code in a way that future-me (and future employers) would approve of
::: 

::: {.notes}
- Had idea of very hyper specific persona and deliverable 
- At start, had no idea if it was going to work or not, remember started this with expressed intention to upskill
- Why? So if it failed, I still would benefit from this and not just write a bunch of sphatettie code that I'd feel embarassed to show
- I wanted:
  + to improve my ability to make interactive apps (mostly quarto before, never big shiny)
  + see what all the AI LLM hype is about to assist with coding
  + productionize what i built
  + write code in a way that future me (and future employers) would know is easy to maintain
:::


# Developing the MVP

::: {.notes}
- At this point, have an idea
- How to build it?
- Can't answer that without doing a bit of a pitstop on why R
:::

## Why R? 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Open Source Programming Language
- Suite of tools that centralize data centric development 
  + _tidyverse_, Posit
- **I** can work very quickly in it
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](fig/R.png)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- Assume most people here have heard of R
- Open source programming language
- If Python is second best for everything, R is the best for data in my opinion
- Quite popular with academics (reason I learned it), but lots of other benefits I can show off
- Most importantly for this project, **I** can work very quickly in it
:::

# Tidyverse Crash Course

## Import and Assignment

```{r}
#| label: syntax-import
#| warning: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-5|8"

library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)


superstore_orders <- read_csv("data/superstore_orders.csv")

```

## Superstore Orders

```{r}
#| echo: false

superstore_orders |>
  select(Category, City,`Country/Region`,`Customer ID`,`Customer Name`, `Order Date`, `Order ID`) |>
  head(15) |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 20)
```


## The Pipe:   |>

:::{.incremental}
- Pipe read as "and then" 
- Start with the table called `superstore_orders`
- And then
- Use the function `clean_names()` on it
- `f(x)` becomes `x |> f()`
:::

```{r}
#| label: syntax-pipe
#| warning: false
#| echo: true
#| output: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1-6|3|5|6"

superstore_orders <- read_csv("data/superstore_orders.csv")

clean_names(superstore_orders)

superstore_orders |>
  clean_names()

```



## Cleaner Names

```{r}
superstore_orders |>
  clean_names() |>
  select(category:order_id) |>
  head(15) |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 20)
```

## Select and Filter

```{r}
#| label: syntax-saf
#| warning: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-6|5|6"

superstore_orders <- read_csv("data/superstore_orders.csv")

cleaned_data <- superstore_orders |>
  clean_names() |>
  select(category, region, quantity) |>
  filter(region != "South") 

```

## Column and Rows Logic

```{r}
#| echo: false
cleaned_data |>
  head(15) |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 20)
```

## Group By and Summarise

```{r}
#| label: syntax-gbs
#| warning: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-6|5|6"

cleaned_data <- superstore_orders |>
  clean_names() |>
  select(category, region, quantity) |>
  filter(region != "South") |>
  group_by(category, region) |>
  summarise(total_quantity = sum(quantity)) 
```

## Summary Table

```{r}
cleaned_data |>
  head(15) |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 20)
```

## Plot It 

```{r}
#| label: syntax-plot
#| warning: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1-10|1|2|3|4|5-9|10|1-10"

my_plot <- cleaned_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = total_quantity, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "A Simple Bar Plot", 
       subtitle = "Southen Region Excluded",
       x = "Category", 
       y = "Total Quantity", 
       fill = "Region") +
  theme_classic()

```

## Final Plot

```{r}
my_plot
```


## Posit Tools

  - LLM for Shiny
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](data/posit.jpg)
![](vid/shiny.jpeg)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- Further, not just tidyverse, but really whole suite of tools
- Quarto: for making documents (this whole slide deck is just flat text file), keyboard shortcuts
- Shiny: Rapid dashboards
- Shiny Assitant: LLM
- Not about to start flame war
- but to have all these tools live in the same ecosystem, huge headache save IMO
- Why? allows you to complete the circle the whole time? 
- what do i mean by this? 
:::

## Production during the process

:::{.incremental}
- Spend minimal time on MVP
- Faster in someone's hands, the better
- Write in environment where it's easy to deploy
- Keep **production** in mind
:::


::: {.notes}
- with Posit ecosystem, paths to production built right in
- Production: take example from book, just means used by someone
- Why important that it's working from start? 
- BC means you can put it infront of customers almost immediate 
:::

## Production for Users and Developers

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
:::{.incremental}
- It is used, even if only by one person.
- It is relied upon by its user(s).
- It has real life impact if something goes wrong.

## Getting Buy-In, AKA Living in Reality
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

- Goal during development: get buy in
- Do this fast
- Age of LLMs, use this to your advantage

::::


::: {.notes}
- what showed there was just toy app
- first iteration of this was even less functional 
- remember, trying to solve real problem here 
- want to get buy in and interst as fast as possible
- important idea from MOM test book is only way you know you are getting closer is if have skin in game
- how do you do that if you're literlly starting with nothing?
- get to the no as fast as possible, if not, keep forward
- First thing was to convice people that was building real product, and if demand there, could shape it
- so used LLM to just sketch out the wireframe
- put it into Assitant, made screen recording of video, posted it, saw who bit
- show LLM tech
- show video, mp, not mvp bc doesn't do anything 
:::

# Move fast using LLMs

## Getting buy-in from small orgs, on right track?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
:::{.incremental}
- Posted video of 45 minutes playing with Shiny Assitant
- Group of Arts Admin people
- Looking for data trade, insights for data
- Got 10 years of data from Orlando Family Stage
:::

:::
::::



::: {.notes}
- posted it in group for arts admin people
- had both symphony orchestra and small theatre company reach out
- said they can have whatever insights from their analysis for free in exhange for data
- got NDA off legal zoom
- Now we're tehtered to reality
- not only have real data, but real person at real organization with real problems
- question is now not what would this person pay, not trying to extort
- but what is the line between making something useful enough to them, but also genralizable
- What features do you build? 
- This is where the critical thinking comes in 
- prepare to be told what you think is not useful
:::

## {background-image="vid/mvp1.gif"}

## Iteration Alpha

::: {.incremental}
- Two weeks of development
  + (refreshing Shiny knowledge)
- Feedback
  + Made worse version of their CRM
  + Want analysis 
  + Want things they couldn't do with basic tools
  
::: 

::: {.notes}
- First version of app was told that I basically was making a worse version of their ticketing CRM
- Was aware this would happen from books I read, but that almost made it worse
- But listened to what they said, said that what people want but don't know how to do is more expert analysis
- this is of course tall order, but flip side is that if you can even make a dent in it, you are solving a real problem 
- Won't go through every iteration, jump forward in time now 
:::

# Bolero 

## {background-image="vid/bolero_gif.gif"}

::: {.notes}
- After a few weeks, ended up with this here
- Few features proud of:
- takes about 600,000 rows, enough to make Excel cry
- incorporated feedback that people want their historical data to contextualize common KPIs (something their CRMs are not good at)
- And has handy export feature: allows user to select show that they want to target, export CSV of all customers who have not purchased a ticket along with common metrics related to their puchasing behavior
- Happy to boot it up after, apologise for low resolution on gif
:::


# Take Aways

::: {.notes}
- This was whirlwind of project I've been working on last few months
- Been a bit eclectic and messy, and tried to do that justice in the presentation
- Cleaning it up, what are the key aha moments
- All experiences here that will also make you a better data scientist
:::

## MicroSaaS allows you to own the entire process

::: {.incremental}
- Pro: Forces you to consider the "so what" from Day 1
- Con: Context switching is difficult
- Pro: Wearing your "product" hat changes how you see your development
- Con: Generate a lot of technical debt if you commit to moving fast
- Pro: Live in an time with freak-level tooling and access to learning
:::

::: {.notes}
- read list 
:::

## Tether yourself to reality

::: {.incremental}
- Long road from problem to payment
- Set self up for success by:
  + How can I work in way that even if it fails, I win?
  + Getting your ideas in front fast
- Real people's real problems
- Skin-in-Game milestones for success
  + Introductions
  + Trading of resources
  + Money
:::

::: {.notes}
- read list
:::

## Practice kindness to future you 

::: {.incremental}
- Develop with "what if this does work?" mindset
- Finding balance between moving fast and being kind to future you
- Code is meant to be read by people 
  + (e.g. you, future colleagues)
::: 

::: {.notes}
- did project to get out of writing code that dev friends joke aobut me with
- one off analyses
- find way to inject longer term thinking in development
- CLICK
:::

# Next Steps 

::: {.notes}
- what is next?
:::

## Launch 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- WeInc. Marketing hosts launch in Spring

![](fig/weinc.jpg)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- have a marketing agency in CA that is very interested in the tool
- One of key people during development
- Launch it, have nice side project to keep it going
- Over the moon if I even had one customer using this 
- Really opportunity to keep learning, esp being relatively new to data world
:::

## Open to Work!

- Spent last year freelancing
- Currently looking for **full time** or **long contract work**
- Would love to talk to anyone hiring **data scientists** 

::: {.notes}
- Said before, spent last year doing one off freelance during time of major transition
- So looking for FT work, anyone hiring and would like to work with me, love to work for a Maine company

##  Abstract 

Building a MicroSaaS forces data scientists to think beyond analysis and requires developing skills in software engineering, writing code that can be used in production, and encourages higher level business thinking. 
In this talk, I’ll demonstrate how tools from the R (mostly Posit!) ecosystem– like R Shiny– can be used to develop a minimum viable product using a ticket sales analysis application. 
I highlight how this process not only improves technical skills, but also enables rapid development of business objectives.
